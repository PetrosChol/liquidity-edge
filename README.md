# Project Title:
Project "Liquidity Edge": A Panel Data Model for Forecasting Transaction Costs Across a Diverse Crypto-Asset Universe

## Objective:
To develop and validate a unified machine learning model that forecasts next-day transaction costs (Relative Quoted Spread) for a diverse portfolio of 8 cryptocurrencies. The model's key innovation is its ability to learn from both coin-specific and market-wide dynamics by incorporating advanced factors derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on microstructure estimators.
